# Joseph Barbier

</div>

I'm passionate about **open-source** development and **data analysis**. I have worked in multiple contexts (research, start-up, freelancing, open source) and on various topics (health, e-commerce, ecology, data visualization).

Today, I live in France, working as a **freelance** data scientist and dedicating time to open-source projects
